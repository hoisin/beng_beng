An OpenGL renderer.

Uses GLM math library

Required libraries
-------------------

assimp-3.1.1
FreeImage
glew-1.10.0
glm




Tasks
-----------------

World object definition
------------------------------

Movement
---------
- Only in the X/Z direction, no height/jumping.

- World consisted of a flat plane and obstructions.
	+ Walls & world boundary.

	
- Movement defined as forward/backward based on direction vector.
- Left/Right rotates object.


	
	
Base class CObject <------------

+ Position
+ rotation (orientation
+ Mesh ID (rendering).

! Bounding sphere/box for collision detection
	- Likely to be from the CMesh


TASKS
--------------

- Redo container management.
	- Use vector, then map to vector element.
	
	+ Remaining:
		- CMeshManager
		- CBufferManager
		- CShaderManager
		- CTextureManager
		- CObjectMGR
		
- Problems with using vectors.
	- class storage and the potential need for polymorphic behaviour.
	- Way to do it is to have a custom memory allocator to store said objects.
	- Then use vector to pointer to point to memory.
	

- Graphic interpolation smoothing on moving objects.	
	
	
	
03/06/2017
-----------------

- Refactored map/vector  containers
		- Switched to vectors only.
		
- Review containers with *ptr, since require polymorphic behaviour.

- Draw lists need custome mem manager probably.


+ Moving to graphic interpolation.
+ Camera movement smoothing.

	
	
04/06/2017
-----------------
- Smoothing for particles done.
- Other objects should be the same.

- Will need to add for rotation smoothing.
- Not yet implemeneted solution for rotating objects

- Camera movement smoothing


++ Will required quaternions for object rotations

Using point light shader.
Pre-define single light inside of the shader code.

Light designs
**************

4 types of light:

- Ambient
- Directional
- Point light
- Spot light

common light properties:

- Colour of light
- Intensity/brightness


Ambient light properies
------------------------
This light type is to simulate general global lighting. A cheat method of simply adding a constant light value rather having to calculate light reflections.

- Colour
- Intensity


Direction Light properties
---------------------------
Type of light where the source is really far away (sun light).

- Colour
- Direction of light
- intensity


Point lightp properties
-----------------------------
Light that comes from a source where the light emits in every direction from the source.

- Colour
- Intensity
- Position (where the light source is in world)
- Attenuation (light fall off).


Spot light properties
------------------------------
Light that comes from a source and shines light in a spot.

- Colour
- Intensity
- Position ( position in world space)
- Direction (direction the spot light is pointing).
- Attenuation (light distance fall off).
- Cone attenuation (light fall off from center of spot to edge.)



Shader.
Lights are uniforms.
-	Array of them that determines which are used or not.

10 Spots and 15 point lights
- 1 direction light and 1 ambient.




Light manager to handle creation of light and determine which are on/off,
